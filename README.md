# Nudlle

## Introduction

Just another PHP framework. It was born for very wrong reasons but I kept it and I have been developing it slowly in the past years to serve my needs. I used it to build a few websites and services, to stay sharp and as a toy and experiment.

Please notice: **Nudlle is not ready for public use.** First, there is no documentation. Second, there is no documentation. Some parts need refactoring and more testing. Did I mention there is no documentation?

## Key features

But since you are reading this for whatever reason, here are some key features:

- PHP 7.0 (trivial backporting to 5.*, but probably not below 5.3)
- Nginx + PHP-FPM (other enviroments possible after some work, I think)
- Low footprint
- Modularity
- Security
- ORM for PostgreSQL (easily adaptable to MySQL and, possibly, other RDBMS)

## Future plans

When is Nudlle going to be finished and be ready for public use? It's a good tool, it has some interesting features and it's definitely useful to me. Now it has to become famous and find thousands of users waiting to be able to use it. Then I will write some more modules, do some refactoring, create a battery of automated tests and write a documentation. And then I will be famous as well.

But making Nudlle famous would require a massive amount of time which I'm not willing to invest into just another PHP framework. I have better uses for my time.

It is licenced under the MIT Licence, so do whatever you wish. Just do not pretend that you are the author and do not blame me when it backfires on you.
